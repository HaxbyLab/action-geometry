## The geometry of observed action representation during natural vision

This repo a manuscript in preparation titled "The geometry of observed action representation during natural vision" by Samuel A. Nastase, Vassiki Chauhan, Rebecca Philip, Yaroslav O. Halchenko, M. Ida Gobbini, and James V. Haxby. This manuscript stems from dissertation work reported by [Nastase, 2018](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2018905893), and builds on related work in the field (e.g., [Tucciarelli et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47686)). We collected fMRI data using a condition-rich design in which participants viewed 90 naturalistic video clips depicting humans performing a variety of social and nonsocial behaviors broadly sampling action space (e.g., conversation, cooking, gardening; [Haxby et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116561)). Our analysis pipline relies on representational similarity analysis ([Kriegeskorte et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008)) and surface-based whole-cortex hyperalignment based on an independent movie dataset ([Guntupalli et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhw068)).
